## Java
I used toString method and boolean primitive data for reading a data. The creating the whole program from UML drawing was really useful to understand the concept of Java. The structure of program out of coding is helpful when I do actual coding to create the program. This projects give me a path for learning how to inheritance from class to class. Connecting the class to proper class was one of the interesting I learn here. They are using some of function but not all of it by their purpose!
